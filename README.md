## 📖 About the Project  

This project consists of two main challenges:  

1. **Pagination Functionality (`pagination.html`)**  
   - Developed a JavaScript function to implement pagination.  
   - Fetched and displayed employee data from a provided dataset.  
   - Ensured smooth navigation between pages with proper indexing.  

2. **Mathematical Calculation (`calculate.html`)**  
   - Completed a given mathematical equation in JavaScript.  
   - Implemented real-time calculations based on user input.  
   - Optimized the solution within a strict time limit during a live coding session.
